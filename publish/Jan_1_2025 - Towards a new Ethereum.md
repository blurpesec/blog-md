 #### Thoughts
 - Ethereum needs a stable token to act as a reliable medium of exchange that isn't reliant on backing of a variably-priced digital asset, while also not being tied to existing power structures and fiat currencies assets. 
	 - This would be necessary for the payments use case for cryptocurrencies, and payments are a clear potential winner use case (i.e - see the success of Tron allowing for USD-based payments in Asia)
 - Funding: Ethereum needs a funding mechanism for research.
	 - Potentially - make it a mechanism based on blob storage fees.
 - Governance: If Ethereum is going to have a funding mechanism - that implies that there will be a store of assets to be used and distributed for research and implementation projects such as payments services and advanced cryptography use-cases, these types of things should be decentralized by default. But the mechanism of distribution of assets requires governance of some form. There has been some work done on a quadratic voting which implies a matching mechanism, but there's also the potential of using Ether as a governance for this. There are concerns around this in the form of many Ether being locked into decentralized finance and staking contracts - so another mechanism that we may use this for is creating governance tokens by burning Ether, in which case this reduces the supply of Ether while also providing a mechanism to create a governance-specific token. 
	 - There are many concerns around token-based governance, specifically concerns related to plutocratic voting mechanisms, and you can read about those here:
