title: Thoughts of an Ethereum ecosystem developer
excerpt: The musings of an Ethereum ecosystem developer

## Purpose of this blog
The blockchain space is often reduced to financial speculation, but its true disruptive potential lies in _rebuilding how people interact with each other and the world_. This blog is my canvas to explore Ethereum’s capacity to enable **practical, human-centric systems** as well as to distill my thoughts and learnings about technology, decentralization, economics, and self.

## About me
I'm a seasoned Ethereum developer with deep ecosystem expertise, contributing since its early days as a hobbyist (circa 2016) and professionally since 2018. My career began at MyEtherWallet during its pivotal growth phase, later transitioning with the founding team to MyCrypto, where I honed my skills in backend infrastructure. In early 2022, our team was acquired by Consensys to strengthen MetaMask—Ethereum’s most widely used wallet—where I architected mission-critical systems powering over tens of millions of monthly active users.

My work at MetaMask primarily spans **core user-facing infrastructure components**:

- Token metadata curation & asset pricing APIs
    
- Anti-phishing detection engines and transaction security tooling
    
- Scalable infrastructure for user asset balances, transaction history, and other on-chain data-based features.

My current interests lie towards decentralization, privacy, economics and blockchain-based gaming (currently, the game I am interested in is [EVE Frontier](https://evefrontier.com/) which straddles the [MUD Framework](https://mud.dev/) for building autonomous worlds by [Lattice.xyz](https://lattice.xyz/))
