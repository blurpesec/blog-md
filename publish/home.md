title: Thoughts of an Ethereum ecosystem dev
excerpt: The musings of an Ethereum ecosystem developer

## About me
I'm a seasoned Ethereum developer with deep ecosystem expertise, contributing since its early days as a hobbyist (circa 2016) and professionally since 2018. My career began at MyEtherWallet during its pivotal growth phase, later transitioning with the founding team to MyCrypto, where I honed my skills in backend infrastructure. In early 2022, our team was acquired by Consensys to strengthen MetaMask—Ethereum’s most widely used wallet—where I architected mission-critical systems powering over tens of millions of monthly active users.

My work at MetaMask primarily spans **core user-facing infrastructure components**:

- Token metadata curation & asset pricing APIs
    
- Anti-phishing detection engines and transaction security tooling
    
- Scalable infrastructure for user asset balances, transaction history, and other on-chain data-based features.

My current interests lie towards decentralization, privacy, economics and blockchain-based gaming (currently, the game I am interested in is [EVE Frontier](https://evefrontier.com/) which straddles the [MUD Framework](https://mud.dev/) for building autonomous worlds by [Lattice.xyz](https://lattice.xyz/))

### Purpose of this blog
The blockchain space is often reduced to financial speculation, but its true disruptive potential lies in rebuilding _how we organize, trust, and interact_ at scale. This blog is my space to explore Ethereum’s capacity to enable **practical, human-centric systems**—from privacy-preserving identity frameworks to decentralized governance models that redistribute agency.

The main intent of this blog is for me to distill my thoughts and learnings about various topics pertaining to my interests
